# Gym Blog Application

I have developed a gym blog application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application is designed with a focus on user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) principles, ensuring ease of use and intuitive design.

## Features

1. **Home Page**:
   - The first page serves as the entry point to the application.
   - The design of this page is optimized for ease of navigation.
   - A slider feature automatically changes the background every 10 seconds, enhancing visual appeal.
